# legacy-slices-audit
This utility app interacts with the Prismic Custom Types API to retrieve all the custom types in use in a Prismic repository. It displays each custom type and lists the associated slices. Additionally, it provides an overview of all slices used across different types and allows the user to download this data in CSV format.
